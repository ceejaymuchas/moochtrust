  <h2>Overview of Our Work</h2>

  <p>
    MOOCH Foundation’s projects are designed to take a holistic approach to child
    development by addressing interconnected challenges such as hunger, lack of
    education, poor sanitation, water scarcity, and inadequate infrastructure. Rural
    children face compounded disadvantages that require coordinated and sustained
    interventions rather than short-term solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our project model emphasizes community participation, accountability, and alignment
    with government development frameworks. By working closely with schools, parents,
    traditional leaders, and local authorities, we ensure that our initiatives respond
    to real needs and remain sustainable long after initial implementation.
  </p>

  <h2>1. School Feeding Programme</h2>

  <p>
    The School Feeding Programme aims to combat hunger and malnutrition among children
    attending rural primary and secondary schools. Many children in remote areas attend
    school on empty stomachs, which negatively affects concentration, attendance, and
    academic performance. MOOCH Foundation provides nutritious meals that support both
    physical growth and cognitive development.
  </p>

  <p>
    This programme prioritizes locally sourced food where possible, supporting smallholder
    farmers and strengthening local food systems. By integrating nutrition education and
    community involvement, the programme contributes to improved health outcomes and
    increased school retention rates, particularly among vulnerable children.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="project-box">
  <h2>2. School Uniforms & Learning Materials Initiative</h2>

  <p>
    Lack of proper school uniforms and learning materials is a significant barrier to
    education in rural Zimbabwe. Children are often excluded from school or attend
    irregularly due to poverty-related challenges. This initiative provides uniforms,
    shoes, stationery, and basic learning materials to ensure children can attend school
    with dignity and confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    By reducing the financial burden on families, this project directly supports
    government efforts to improve access to education and reduce dropout rates. The
    initiative also promotes equality by ensuring that no child is stigmatized due to
    their socio-economic background.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="project-box">
  <h2>3. Dignity for Girls – Sanitary Wear Programme</h2>

  <p>
    Menstrual health remains a major challenge for girls in rural communities, often
    leading to absenteeism and school dropouts. The Dignity for Girls Programme provides
    sanitary wear, underwear, and menstrual health education to school-going girls,
    enabling them to attend school consistently and with dignity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This programme addresses gender inequality in education and aligns with national
    priorities on gender empowerment, health, and education. By creating safe spaces for
    dialogue and awareness, MOOCH Foundation helps break cultural stigmas and supports the
    overall well-being of adolescent girls.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="project-box">
  <h2>4. Clean Water & Sanitation Projects</h2>

  <p>
    Access to clean and safe drinking water is essential for child health and development.
    In many rural communities, children walk long distances to fetch unsafe water, which
    exposes them to waterborne diseases. MOOCH Foundation implements borehole drilling,
    water purification systems, and sanitation awareness programmes in schools and
    communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    These projects contribute to improved health outcomes, reduced disease burden, and
    increased school attendance. Water committees are trained to manage and maintain
    infrastructure, ensuring sustainability and community ownership of resources.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="project-box">
  <h2>5. Rural School Construction & Rehabilitation</h2>

  <p>
    Many rural schools operate under unsafe and overcrowded conditions, including
    dilapidated classrooms and inadequate sanitation facilities. MOOCH Foundation works
    to construct new classrooms, rehabilitate existing structures, and improve school
    environments to support quality learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project aligns with national education infrastructure development goals and
    supports the creation of safe, inclusive, and child-friendly learning spaces. By
    engaging communities in construction efforts, the programme promotes ownership,
    skills transfer, and long-term maintenance.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Sustainability & Community Engagement</h2>

  <p>
    Sustainability is central to all MOOCH Foundation projects. Community involvement,
    transparency, and collaboration with government institutions ensure that projects
    continue to benefit children beyond initial implementation. Monitoring and evaluation
    mechanisms are integrated into each project to measure impact and guide continuous
    improvement.
